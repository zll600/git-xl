# Example

An example for macos:

1. Build from source, See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)
2. Install this tool in a local repository:

Enter the repository root folder, and run:

```bash
../../dist/git-xl-arm64 install --local
```

replace the `../../dist/git-xl-arm64` with the relative path to the git-xl executable build by yourself.

Use git diff to see the changes of vba macros:

```bash
git diff
```
